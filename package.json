  "description": "There are numerous hooks emerging in the market that can be integrated into Uniswap v4 pools. But what are the chances that a user will find a hook that fits 100% of their needs? For example, I might want to launch an LBP pool with a whitelist that operates only during exchange working hours. After 7 days, I might want to convert this pool into a regular one (on the LBP end date). The likelihood of finding a single hook that covers all these needs is close to zero. This forces me to hire a developer to combine the hooks into one contract. And even after that, no one will fully trust the code without an audit, even if all the individual hooks used are audited.",
